# martins-aquarium

## project status

incomplete - still updating with newly learned concepts

### description 

The purpose of Martin's Aquarium is to filter and display types of fish on a website. The fish types are sorted into 3 groups and display as such when the code is alerted to make that change. 
In Martin's Aquarium, HTML and CSS were the starting points of the code. 
JavaScript components were added later and are still currently being added.
